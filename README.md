## Running the Server

To run the server, make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

Then, in the root of this project, run:

```bash
cargo run
```

The server will start on `127.0.0.1:1337`.

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) to see the site.

If you visit an unknown path, a 404 page will be returned.
